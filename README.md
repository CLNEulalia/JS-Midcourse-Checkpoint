# Midcourse JS Checkpoint

Congratulations on completing the first half of SEI! üéâ ü•Ç

Before we move onto backend development and NodeJS, let's make sure our JavaScript essentials are in excellent shape after our React Unit.

## Set Up:

1. Fork and clone this directory to your sandbox.
2. Checkout a dev branch.
3. Run `npm install` within the directory to download necessary dependencies.
4. Open this repo in your text editor with your `code` command.

## Instructions:

Write the JavaScript necessary to complete each prompt in each of the three files. Your goal is to get as many tests as possible to PASS during this hour! ‚è≤Ô∏è

**IMPORTANT**:

- Make sure to use the `var` keyword for **ALL** variable declarations (for testing purposes). **DO NOT** use `const` or `let`.
- **DO NOT** modify the files in the `/test/` folder.

This checkpoint is divided into two sections. The suggested order is as follows:

1. Accessing and manipulating "X-Files"-themed data in complex objects and arrays in `objects.js` üëΩ

2. Higher-order array methods to iterate over art data in `arrays.js` üñºÔ∏è

### How to Run Tests

To run the tests in the terminal, run `npm test`. Every time you make a change and save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests. When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many pass as you can in the hour provided.

## BONUS

If you finished early, check out [Slips](https://ga-dc.github.io/slips/). This is a great resource to test your development knowledge and prep for technical interviews!
