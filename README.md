# Midcourse JS Checkpoint

Congratulations on completing the first half of SEI! ðŸ¥‚

Before we move onto backend development, let's make sure our JavaScript essentials are in excellent shape after our React Unit.

## Before You Start:

1. Fork and clone this directory to your sandbox.
2. Checkout a dev branch.
3. Run `npm install` within the director to download necessary dependencies.
4. Open this repo in your text editor.

## Instructions:

This checkpoint is divided into two sections. The suggested order is as follows:

1. Accessing and manipulating data in complex objects and arrays in `objects.js`
2. Higher-order array methods in `arrays.js`

Each section has a series of prompts written in inline-comments. Write the JavaScript necessary to complete each prompt in each of the three files. **DO NOT** modify any of the comments or the tests may fail.

Your goal is to get as many tests as possible to PASS during this hour!

**IMPORTANT**:

- Make sure to use the `var` keyword for **ALL** variable declarations (for testing purposes). **DO NOT** use `const` or `let`.

- **DO NOT** modify the files in the `/test/` folder.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests in the terminal, run `npm test`. Every time you make a change and save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests. When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many pass as you can in the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.
